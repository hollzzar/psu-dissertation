# Experiment 3: Investigating fine-grained perceptual changes from exposure to Spanish-accented stops

## Methods

The exposure phase was the same as Experiment 2, but the task used in the test phase was different.

### Design

To better detect subtle changes in perception as a function of exposure to Spanish-accented speech, we implemented the primed cross-modal lexical decision task from @xie2017similarity.
This design is illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:exp3-fig).
We maintained the same three types of Target: Identity, Competitor, and Unrelated.
However, participants performed a different task with these targets relative to Experiment 2.
Specifically, participants decided whether the visual target was a real English word or not.
The auditory primes should increase or decrease RTs on the visual targets as a function of perceptual adaptation to Spanish-accented voiceless stops.

### Participants {#methods-pars-2}

We recruited `r par_all[4]` participants through Prolific; none had participated in Experiments 1 or 2.
All aspects of recruitment and criteria for data exclusion were the same as in Experiments 1 and 2.
After removing ineligible participants, `r par_diff$elig_2[4]` remained.
After removing participants with poor data quality, `r par_qual[4]` remained for analysis (`r par_text$report[4]`).

Additionally, a new group of `r par_all[5]` participants was also recruited to complete the experiment without the exposure phase.
There were `r par_diff$elig_2[5]` participants remaining after checking the eligibility criteria, and `r par_qual[5]` participants remained after checking for data quality (`r par_text$report[5]`).

### Stimuli

The real words and pseudowords in the exposure task were the same as those in Experiment 2.
The auditory primes in the test task were also the same.
The only difference was in the visual targets.

The unrelated target for each filler prime (144) was replaced with a pseudoword with a different filler onset from the prime.
Potential pseudowords were downloaded from the ELP's set of normed pseudowords.
The best possible match was selected for each prime by (orthographic) vowel and number of letters.
Three additional pseudoword targets were selected for practice.

### Experimental lists

The experimental lists for the exposure task were the same as in Experiment 2.
Talker assignment was also counterbalanced the same way.

For the critical primes (72), the combinations of auditory prime and visual target were counterbalanced across participants in three experimental lists as in Experiment 2.
For the filler primes (144), perfect counterbalancing across these three lists was not possible, since three quarters of the filler items in each list (108) needed to have unrelated pseudoword targets.
Three sets of primes, divided evenly by onset, were rotated through the assignment of Identity or Unrelated (pseudoword) target as evenly as possible.
This resulted in 12 experimental lists for the test phase, one for each combination of critical prime-target pair (3) and talker assignment (4).

### Tasks and procedure

The headphone check, exposure task, and post-experiment questionnaire were the same as Experiment 2.
The procedure was also the same.
The only difference was in the structure of the test task.

The test phase featured the cross-modal primed lexical decision task from @xie2017similarity.
On each trial, participants first heard a real word (auditory prime) and then saw a real word or pseudoword written on the screen (visual target).
They indicated whether the visual target was a real English word or not by pressing the *d* or *k* key on their keyboard.
The real word response was mapped to the same key as in the exposure task.
Participants completed six practice trials followed by 216 main trials presented in random order.
Half of the practice trials (3) and half of the main trials (108) required real word responses.
All of the trials with critical primes (72) required real word responses.

### Analysis

The data processing, model fitting, and analysis approaches were the same as in Experiment 2.
Prior to analyzing exposure task performance for real words with experimental onsets, we removed responses with RTs less than 50 ms (*N* = `r dat_rem_exp$rem_1[3]`; `r dat_rem_exp$pct_1[3]`).
We then detected and removed outliers (*N* = `r dat_rem_exp$rem_2[3]`; `r dat_rem_exp$pct_2[3]`).
Prior to analyzing test task performance for critical prime-target pairs, we removed responses with RTs less than 50 ms (*N* = `r dat_rem_test$rem_1[3]`; `r dat_rem_test$pct_1[3]`).
We then detected and removed outliers (*N* = `r dat_rem_test$rem_2[3]`; `r dat_rem_test$pct_2[3]`).

## Results

### Exposure

For accuracy, there was a significant interaction between Variability and Word type (`r exp_acc_2_comp_2_form`), with higher accuracy on pseudowords in Variant groups (`r exp_acc_2_means_simple_var_non`) compared to Invariant groups (`r exp_acc_2_means_simple_invar_non`; `r exp_acc_2_comp_simple_non`).
We also conducted pairwise comparisons within each combination of Similarity and Word type and within each combination of Variability and Word type.
There were no significant effects of Variability or Similarity, respectively (*ps* > .05).
These comparisons are shown in the left column of Figure \@ref(fig:exp3-exp-fig).

For RT, there was a significant three-way interaction among Variability, Similarity, and Word type (`r exp_rt_2_comp_3_form`).
The two-way interaction between Similarity and Word type was also significant (`r exp_rt_2_comp_2_form`).
To follow up on the three-way interaction, we analyzed the simple effects of Variability and Similarity; however, none of the pairwise comparisons was significant (*ps* > .05).
These comparisons are shown in the right column of Figure \@ref(fig:exp3-exp-fig).

```

### Test: Comparison to the Test-only group

For accuracy, we observed a significant interaction between Exposure and Target (`r test_acc_2_comp_form`); however, pairwise comparisons within each level of Target did not reveal any significant differences between the Test-only group and the exposure groups (*ps* > .05).
Comparing the exposure groups to one another, we found that accuracy on Identity targets was significantly higher in the Indirect-Invariant group (`r test_acc_2_train_indir_invar`) than in either the Indirect-Variant group (`r test_acc_2_train_indir_var`; `r test_acc_2_train_comp_indir_varinvar`) or the Direct-Variant group (`r test_acc_2_train_dir_var`; `r test_acc_2_train_comp_indirinvar_dirvar`).
By-participant means and estimated marginal means are shown in the top row of Figure \@ref(fig:exp3-test-fig1).

For RT, we also observed a significant interaction between Exposure and Target (`r test_rt_2_comp_form`).
This interaction was driven by slower RTs on Competitor targets in the Direct-Invariant group (`r test_rt_2_train_invsim`) than in the Test-only group (`r test_rt_2_train_no`; `r test_rt_2_no_invsim`).
Distributions, by-participant means, and estimated marginal means are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:exp3-test-fig1).
To investigate the differences between exposure conditions, we conducted the second set of analyses comparing the effects of Variability and Similarity on RTs.

Bottom row presents half violin plots with reaction times for correct responses and dot plots with mean reaction times for correct responses by participant.

```

### Test: Comparison between Variability and Similarity

For RT, we observed significant two-way interactions between Variability and Target (`r test_rt_2a_comp_var_form`) and between Similarity and Target (`r test_rt_2a_comp_sim_form`).
We followed up on these interactions with separate pairwise comparisons for Variability and Similarity within each level of Target; however, the pairwise comparisons between levels of Variability and between levels of Similarity were not significant (*ps* > .05).
To further probe the source of the interactions in the model, we conducted pairwise comparisons between Direct and Indirect exposure within each combination Target and Variability and between Variant and Invariant exposure within each combination of Target and Similarity.
Within the Competitor level of Target and Direct level of Similarity, Invariant exposure yielded slower RTs (`r test_rt_2a_mean_comp_dir_invar`) than Variant exposure (`r test_rt_2a_mean_comp_dir_var; test_rt_2a_comp_dir_varinvar`).
None of the other pairwise comparisons by Target and Similarity was significant, nor were any of the pairwise comparisons by Target and Variability (*ps* > .05).

## Discussion

Experiment 3 followed up on the findings of Experiment 2 with a different test task.
Recall that in Experiment 2, we observed significantly higher accuracy on Competitor targets in the Direct-Invariant group than in any of the other exposure groups.
However, the Test-only group performed similarly to the exposure groups, limiting our interpretation of the effects of Variability and Similarity.
We posited that Direct-Invariant training reduced lexical competition between voiced and voiceless stops, thereby increasing correct rejection of Competitor targets as matches for the Spanish-accented auditory primes.
The matching task required participants to explicitly compare the visual target to the auditory prime.
In Experiment 3, we took a more implicit approach.
The priming task probed the extent to which the auditory prime increased or decreased activation of the visual target.
In this way, we could investigate changes in the perception of Spanish-accented stops.

When we compared the four exposure conditions to the Test-only condition, we observed slower RTs for Competitor targets after Direct-Invariant exposure.
We interpret this reduction in speed as a reduction in lexical competition.
For example, consider the auditory prime *park* and the visual target *bark*, which are minimal pairs that differ only in the voicing of their onsets.
The more the onset of *park* is perceived as /b/, the more it will activate the target *bark*.
This increase in activation will facilitate the lexical decision for *bark*, resulting in faster RTs.
Our results suggest that, in the absence of exposure to Spanish-accented speech, Spanish-accented *park* was perceived **more** like *bark*.
By contrast, with Direct-Invariant exposure, Spanish-accented *park* was perceived **less** like *bark*.
This reduction in the activation of voiced targets after training suggests that talker-specific exposure to Spanish-accented /p/, /t/, and /k/ improved phonetic categorization of short lag VOTs as voiceless.
Based on this evidence for talker-independent adaptation, we conducted analyses to distinguish the effects of Variability and Similarity.

Within the Direct conditions, Invariant exposure reduced the activation of voiced competitors more than Variant exposure.
This effect was illustrated by significantly slower RTs on Competitor targets for the Direct-Invariant group than for the Direct-Variant group.
As described in the previous paragraph, the Direct-Invariant group was also slower on Competitor targets than the Test-only group.
Together, these results suggest that the Test-only and Direct-Variant groups exhibited similar levels of *park*-*bark* priming, indexing increased activation of /b/ by Spanish-accented /p/.
This finding is striking, considering that the Direct-Variant group had the same amount of exposure to Spanish-accented /p/, /t/, and /k/ from the same talkers as the Direct-Invariant group.
We will interpret this effect of Variability more fully in Section \@ref(discuss-study1).
In short, we will argue that listeners were not able to develop robust talker-independent models during Variant exposure.
Because this level of organization is subject to listeners' use of indexical and social information [@kleinschmidt2019], we will investigate their perceptions of the test talkers in the next section.
