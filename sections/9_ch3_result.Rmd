## Results

### Behavioral results

#### Target type analysis

We observed a significant interaction between Target and Exposure (`r behave_comp_int`), as well as main effects of Target (`r behave_comp_target`) and Exposure (`r behave_comp_exp`).
The rate of improvement on Test targets (`r omni_behave_means_test`) was greater than that on Filler targets (`r omni_behave_means_filler`; `r omni_behave_cont_report`).

This difference in adaptation between target types is illustrated by comparing the estimated marginal mean accuracy at the beginning of the task (Exposure = -36) to that at the end (Exposure = 36).
Accuracy on Filler targets started at `r omni_behave_est_filler_1` and ended at `r omni_behave_est_filler_2`, while accuracy on Test targets started at `r omni_behave_est_test_1` and ended at `r omni_behave_est_test_2`.
Accuracy significantly improved between these two time points for both Filler (`r omni_behave_est_cont_filler`) and Test (`r omni_behave_est_cont_test`) targets.
However, the enhanced rate of learning for test targets resulted in a significant difference between Filler and Test target accuracy at the end of the task (`r omni_behave_est_cont_2`) that was not present at the beginning (`r omni_behave_est_cont_1`).
The results are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:behave-fig).

#### Prime type analysis

We observed significant main effects of Prime (`r test_comp_prime`) and Exposure (`r test_comp_exp`).
The interaction between the two factors was not significant (`r test_comp_int`).
Overall, accuracy increased with exposure regardless of prime type (`r omni_test_exp_slope_report`).
Within prime type, accuracy increased linearly from Unrelated (`r omni_test_prime_un`) to Competitor (`r omni_test_prime_compete`) to Identity (`r omni_test_prime_id`) targets.
Accuracy was significantly different among the different levels of Prime: Identity versus Competitor (`r omni_test_cont_id_compete`), Identity versus Unrelated (`r omni_test_cont_id_un`), and Competitor versus Unrelated (`r omni_test_cont_compete_un`).
The results are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:test-fig).

#### Summary

The behavioral data provide strong evidence for talker-specific adaptation to Spanish-accented voiceless stops.
We first compared accuracy on test targets, with voiceless stop onsets that were perceptually confusible with voiced stops (e.g., *park*-*bark*), to accuracy on filler targets (e.g., *rhubarb*).
Exposure was operationalized as the (mean-centered) number of exposure targets (e.g., *passage*) that the participant had heard before encountering a given target.
Participants adapted to both the talker and task, exhibiting improved accuracy on both types of targets; however, improvements in word recognition were strongest for the test targets.
This enhanced performance on test targets suggests that exposure to disambiguating lexical contexts for Spanish-accented /p/, /t/, and /k/ improved perception in ambiguous lexical contexts.

```

We then compared accuracy on test targets for each type of prime: Identity, Competitor, and Unrelated.
While overall accuracy increased with exposure, as demonstrated in the previous analysis, priming effects remained stable.
These priming effects were in the expected direction, with Identity primes yielding the highest accuracy on Test targets, followed by Competitor primes, then Unrelated primes.

#### 175-250 ms

We observed a significant interaction between Prime and Exposure (`r n1_comp_int`), as well as main effects of Prime (`r n1_comp_prime`) and Exposure (`r n1_comp_exp`).
Specifically, we observed an increase in N1 amplitude following Identity primes (`r omni_n1_id`) that contrasted with a decrease in amplitude following Competitor primes (`r omni_n1_compete`) and Unrelated primes (`r omni_n1_un`).
Pairwise comparisons as a function of Exposure revealed significant differences among all three types of primes: Identity versus Competitor (`r omni_n1_id_compete`), Identity versus Unrelated (`r omni_n1_id_un`), and Competitor versus Unrelated (`r omni_n1_compete_un`).

To contextualize the interaction, we report differences in Prime at the lowest (-36) and highest (36) amounts of Exposure (see Figure \@ref(fig:erp-eff-fig), N1).
At the beginning of the task, the N1 was largest for Test targets following Unrelated primes (`r omni_n1_un_prime_1`), with successively smaller amplitudes for Competitor primes (`r omni_n1_compete_prime_1`) and Identity primes (`r omni_n1_id_prime_1`).
Pairwise comparisons showed significant differences in amplitude for Identity versus Unrelated (`r omni_n1_id_un_prime_1`) and Competitor versus Unrelated (`r omni_n1_compete_un_prime_1`); however, the difference in amplitude for Identity versus Competitor (`r omni_n1_id_compete_prime_1`) was not significant.
By the end of the task, this order had reversed from Identity primes (`r omni_n1_id_prime_2`) to Competitor primes (`r omni_n1_compete_prime_2`) to Unrelated primes (`r omni_n1_un_prime_2`).
These amplitudes were all significantly different from one another: Identity versus Competitor (`r omni_n1_id_compete_prime_2`), Identity versus Unrelated (`r omni_n1_id_un_prime_2`), and Competitor versus Unrelated (`r omni_n1_compete_un_prime_2`).
However, within each prime type, the change in amplitude was not significant for the Identity condition (`r omni_n1_means_exp_cont_id`).
By contrast, Competitor priming (`r omni_n1_means_exp_cont_compete`) and Unrelated priming (`r omni_n1_means_exp_cont_un`) increased significantly from the beginning to the end of the task.

#### 250-375 ms

As in the previous time window, we observed a significant interaction between Prime and Exposure (`r p2_comp_int`).
We also observed a main effect of Prime (`r p2_comp_prime`).
The interaction was driven by an increase in P2 amplitude following Unrelated primes (`r omni_p2_un`) in contrast with a decrease following Identity primes (`r omni_p2_id`) and Competitor primes (`r omni_p2_compete`).
Pairwise comparisons as a function of Exposure revealed significant differences among all three types of primes: Identity versus Competitor (`r omni_n4_id_compete`), Identity versus Unrelated (`r omni_n4_id_un`), and Competitor versus Unrelated (`r omni_n4_compete_un`).

To investigate the differences in priming across the task, we conducted pairwise comparisons of the effects at the beginning and end of the task (see Figure \@ref(fig:erp-eff-fig), P2).
During the initial stages of adaptation, Identity primes elicited larger P2 effects on Test targets (`r omni_p2_id_prime_1`) than Competitor primes (`r omni_p2_compete_prime_1`; `r omni_p2_id_compete_prime_1`) or Unrelated primes (`r omni_p2_un_prime_1`; `r omni_p2_id_un_prime_1`).
Competitor and Unrelated primes did not differ from one another (`r omni_p2_compete_un_prime_1`).
In the later stages of adaptation, Identity primes (`r omni_p2_id_prime_2`) elicited similar effects to Competitor primes (`r omni_p2_compete_prime_2`; `r omni_p2_id_compete_prime_2`).
At the same time, Unrelated primes (`r omni_p2_un_prime_2`) diverged from competitor primes (`r omni_p2_compete_un_prime_2`).
Identity and Unrelated primes remained different from one another (`r omni_p2_id_un_prime_2`), though in the opposite direction.
Overall, the effects of Competitor primes remained stable in this time window (`r omni_p2_means_exp_cont_compete`), while those of Identity primes (`r omni_p2_means_exp_cont_id`) and Unrelated primes (`r omni_p2_means_exp_cont_un`) reversed.

#### 450-650 ms

We observed a significant interaction between Prime and Exposure (`r n4_comp_int`), a main effect of Prime (`r n4_comp_prime`), and a main effect of Exposure (`r n4_comp_exp`).
As in the N1 time window, the interaction was driven by an increase in amplitude following Identity primes (`r omni_n4_id`) coupled with a decrease in amplitude following Competitor primes (`r omni_n4_compete`) and Unrelated primes (`r omni_n4_un`).
These slopes were significantly different from one another: Identity versus Competitor (`r omni_n4_id_compete`), Identity versus Unrelated (`r omni_n4_id_un`), and Competitor versus Unrelated (`r omni_n4_compete_un`).

We observed a typical N400 effect at the beginning of the experiment, with amplitudes increasing from Identity (`r omni_n4_id_prime_1`) to Competitor (`r omni_n4_compete_prime_1`) to Unrelated (`r omni_n4_un_prime_1`) primes (see Figure \@ref(fig:erp-eff-fig), N400).
These effects were all significantly different from one another: Identity versus Competitor (`r omni_n4_id_compete_prime_1`), Identity versus Unrelated (`r omni_n4_id_un_prime_1`), and Competitor versus Unrelated (`r omni_n4_compete_un_prime_1`).
By the end of the experiment, these effects had converged, with Identity (`r omni_n4_id_prime_2`), Competitor (`r omni_n4_compete_prime_2`), and Unrelated (`r omni_n4_un_prime_2`) primes eliciting similar N400 effects: Identity versus Competitor (`r omni_n4_id_compete_prime_2`), Identity versus Unrelated (`r omni_n4_id_un_prime_2`), and Competitor versus Unrelated (`r omni_n4_compete_un_prime_2`).
This convergence in priming effects was driven by significant changes in Identity priming (`r omni_n4_means_exp_cont_id`) and Unrelated priming (`r omni_n4_means_exp_cont_un`), while Competitor priming remained the same (`r omni_n4_means_exp_cont_compete`).

#### Summary

The results of the ERP analyses revealed a shift from lexico-semantic to acoustic processing over time.
These changes are illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:erp-eff-fig).

```{r erp-eff-fig, fig.cap = "Estimated marginal mean amplitudes by Prime and Exposure on the N1, P2, and N400.", fig.pos="H", dpi = 300}
knitr::include_graphics("sections/code/outputs/erp_eff.png")
```

Between 175 and 250 ms, the amplitude of the neurocognitive responses to Competitor and Unrelated primes decreased in negativity with increasing exposure.
The N1 component in this time window is sensitive to the perception of voicing contrasts, with voiced stops eliciting larger (more negative) amplitudes than voiceless stops [@getz2021].
At the beginning of the experiment, Identity and Competitor priming effects patterned together (Unrelated > Competitor = Identity).
By the end of the experiment, N1 amplitude exhibited graded sensitivity to prime type (Identity > Competitor > Unrelated).
The decrease in negativity for the two mismatched prime types reflects improvements in perception of the ambiguous test targets.

In the 250-375 ms time window, Unrelated priming effects became more positive, while Identity priming effects became less positive with exposure.
The P2 component elicited in this time window indexes phonetic categorization, with less effortful processing associated with larger (more positive) amplitudes [@crowley2004].
P2 amplitude exhibited a reversal in priming effects from the beginning (Identity > Competitor = Unrelated) to the end (Unrelated > Competitor = Identity) of the task.
The increase in positivity for Unrelated prime trials reflects facilitation of categorizing the ambiguous Test targets with increased exposure.

The same differential effects of prime type were observed in the 450-650 ms time window, with Unrelated priming effects becoming less negative and Identity priming effects becoming more negative with exposure.
The N400 component in this time window indexes lexico-semantic access, with more effortful processing associated with larger (more negative) amplitudes [@federmeier2021].
Overall, the N400 started with graded sensitivity to prime type (Unrelated > Competitor > Identity) and ended with a lack of sensitivity (Unrelated = Competitor = Identity).
The reduction in the difference between Identity and Unrelated primes suggests that lexico-semantic processing became less sensitive to prime type over time.

### Correlation results

Pairwise correlations are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:erp-corr-fig).
Only items with significant correlations are displayed.

```{r erp-corr-fig, fig.cap = "Correlation matrix between task performance and post-experiment questionnaire items.", fig.pos="H", dpi = 300}
knitr::include_graphics("sections/code/outputs/corr_plot_2.png")
```

Of particular interest is the negative correlation between proactive IC and the magnitude of the N1 priming effect (`r corr_pro_n1`), with smaller differences between matching and mismatching primes associated with better response inhibition.
This relation suggests that the AX-CPT and LDT share a common inhibitory control mechanism.
We also observed a positive correlation between receptive vocabulary and comprehensibility ratings (`r corr_lex_comp`), with higher LexTALE scores associated with more confidence in task performance.
Overall, the results of the correlation analysis highlight the influence of more general cognitive/linguistic abilities on task performance.
