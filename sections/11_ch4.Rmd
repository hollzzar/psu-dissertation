# General conclusion

## Summary

This dissertation investigated adaptation to L2-accented speech.
Spanish-accented voiceless stop VOT was the focus of the experimental manipulations.
Due to cross-language transfer from Spanish to English in production, the voiceless stops /p/, /t/, and /k/ can be perceptually confusable with their voiced counterparts /b/, /d/, and /g/.
The ambiguity between voiced and voiceless stop pairs in Spanish-accented English is based on their VOT distributions.
L1 English listeners tend to associate short lag VOTs with voiced stops, while Spanish-accented English talkers tend to produce short lag VOTs for voiceless stops.
In order to adapt to Spanish-accented productions of voiceless stops, listeners must learn to associate short lag VOTs with a different set of phonetic categories.
The ideal adapter framework provides useful conceptual tools for investigating this process [@kleinschmidt2019; @kleinschmidt2015].
This framework posits that listeners use statistical learning to update generative models of the distributions of phonetic categories over acoustic cues.
I used the ideal adapter framework to answer the following questions: Does increased covariation during exposure enhance talker-independent adaptation beyond exposure-test similarity (Study 1)? Does covariation along one cue-category mapping facilitate generalization to related mappings (Study 1)? What are the relative contributions of phonetic and semantic levels of processing to perceptual adaptation (Study 2)?

## Does increased covariation during exposure enhance talker-independent adaptation beyond exposure-test similarity?

The results of Study 1 (Chapter 2) suggest that *decreased* covariation in conjunction with exposure-test similarity enhances talker-independent adaptation.
In Experiment 2, we found that Direct-Invariant exposure reduced the activation of lexical competitors relative to Indirect-Invariant exposure in terms of accuracy on the matching task.
In Experiment 3, Direct-Invariant exposure also reduced lexical competition relative to both the Test-only group and Direct-Invariant exposure in terms of RT on the primed cross-modal lexical decision task.
In both cases, we did not observe any evidence that Variant exposure benefited test performance.
In fact, we found evidence that Invariant exposure actually improved generalization.
There were two explanations for this finding: (1) the talker-independent generative models that listeners developed with Variant exposure were not as useful as the talker-specific generative models that listeners developed with Invariant exposure (2) listeners developed talker-specific generative models regardless of variability, which led to sub-optimal representations of Variant exposure.
Both of these accounts would be consistent with exposure to different VOT distributions for each talker.
To investigate talker-specific VOT-stop distributions, Figure \@ref(fig:spk-vot-fig) plots the density of each talker's VOT values across the Direct and Indirect real words from the exposure phase.
Focusing on the voiceless stops encountered during Direct exposure (second row), we can see that the VOT distributions varied by both talker and place of articulation.
This variation is illustrated by comparing both the means and shapes of each distribution, particularly for /p/ (bottom left panel).
Since Direct-Invariant exposure associated each place of articulation with only one talker, listeners did not need to keep track of talkers and places of articulation separately; rather, these sources of variation were collapsed.
Overall, our results suggest that limiting the sources of variation in L2-accented speech facilitates adaptation to specific cue-category mappings.
In terms of the ideal adapter framework, these findings suggest that developing talker-specific generative models for multiple talkers may be the best approach when between-talker and between-category variability is high.

## Does covariation along one cue-category mapping facilitate generalization to related mappings?

The results of Study 1 (Chapter 2) suggest that covariation in VOT-voiced stop mappings generalizes to VOT-voiceless stop mappings.
Specifically, in Experiment 3, Indirect-Invariant exposure increased the activation of lexical targets relative to Direct-Invariant exposure in terms of RT on the primed cross-modal lexical decision task.
This finding was unexpected based on previous research and the ideal adapter framework, because it relies on indirect evidence for shifted VOT distributions.
In Indirect conditions, listeners were exposed to lead VOTs in supporting lexical contexts (e.g., *beehive*).
Exposure to these atypical distributions (for L1-accented English) shifted the representations of the VOT distributions for voiced stops from short lag to lead.
In turn, this leftward shift in VOTs for voiced stops triggered a leftward shift in VOTs for voiceless stops, moving the distribution from long lag to short lag.

Considering Figure \@ref(fig:spk-vot-fig), we can see that the VOT distributions for Talkers 1-3's voiceless stops are more short lag than long lag.
The prevalence of these relatively English-like VOT values disrupts the logic of this argument for shifting distributions; an L1 listener's existing generative models of VOT-voiceless stop distributions would be sufficient for categorization.
If listeners did not strictly *need* to adapt, then why did we observe adaptation effects?
One possibility is the presence of an overall L2 accent beyond stop production.
Across the 648 participants in Experiments 1-3, all but nine indicated that the test talker had an accent.
Moreover, more than 90% of participants identified the test talker as a bilingual.
The talkers' L2-accented features may have encouraged listeners to develop new generative models according to this socio-indexical information [@kleinschmidt2019].
Furthermore, development may have been enhanced by exposure to the shifted VOT distributions for voiced stops.
Another possibility is that the shift in VOTs for voiced stops prompted listeners to re-weight the acoustic cues to voicing [@shultz2012; @clayards2017; @crinnion2024; @toscanomc2010].
That is, instead of using VOT as the primary cue, listeners may have begun to use secondary cues like fundamental frequency.
Updating cue weights may have then benefited perception of voiceless stops during test.

## What are the relative contributions of phonetic and semantic levels of processing to perceptual adaptation?

The experiments in Study 1 (Chapter 2) investigated talker-independent adaptation to Spanish-accented speech.
The experiment in Study 2 (Chapter 3) focused on talker-specific adaptation.
The goal was to investigate the relative contributions of acoustic-phonetic and lexico-semantic levels of processing.
In behavioral paradigms, exposure to a talker's cue-category mappings during exposure facilitates perception of the same talker during test compared to a different talker.
In neurocognitive paradigms, adaptation is not typically the primary focus; as a result, effects of perceptual adaptation on neural signatures are less clear.
We observed differences in VOT perception on the N1 and in phonetic categorization on the P2, which emerged as differences in priming on the N400 disappeared.
The changes we observed in response to Unrelated primes on the N1-P2 complex highlight the role of selective attention in adaptation.
Previous ERP research has shown that the N1-P2 complex reflects the deployment of attention to specific aspects of the speech signal [@joos2014; @hillyard1973; @sanders2008].
Previous behavioral work on perceptual adaptation has also demonstrated a link between these two constructs [@francis2008; @tzeng2024; @kim2020].
It is possible that the reduction in N400 effects reflects a shift in attention from the visual prime to the actual speech signal.

## Limitations and future directions

Based on theories of L1-L2 transfer in the language system, we assumed that the mean stop VOTs produced by Spanish-accented talkers would be Spanish-like.
That is, we assumed that voiceless stops would be likely to have short lag VOTs and voiced stops would be likely to have lead VOTs.
When we calculated the VOTs produced by our four talkers, we found that voiced stop VOTs were generally Spanish-like, but voiceless stop VOTs were not (see Figure \@ref(fig:spk-vot-fig)).
In Study 1 (Chapter 2), the reduction in ambiguity between voiced and voiceless stops reduced the need for adaptation at all, which is likely why performance in the Test-only condition did not differ greatly from performance in any of the exposure conditions.
Another aspect of the stimuli that is worth noting is the difference in VOT distributions between voiced and voiceless stops.
As Figure \@ref(fig:spk-vot-fig) shows, the range of VOT values for voiced stops was nearly twice as wide as the range for voiceless stops.
Moreover, the shapes of the distributions were quite different.
Voiceless stop VOTs were more normally distributed (with the exception of Talker 4’s distribution for /p/), while voiced stop VOTs varied by talker and place of articulation.
In Study 2 (Chapter 3), Talker 4’s voiceless stop VOTs were shortened by 25% to bring them more fully into the short lag range; however, the shape of the distribution was not altered.
Future iterations of Studies 1 and 2 could both reduce the mean VOTs and change the shape of the VOT distributions to further investigate how cue-category variability influences adaptation.

## Conclusion

Across four experiments, this dissertation explored both talker-specific and talker-independent adaptation to Spanish-accented speech.
VOT provided a window into the adaptation process in both brain and behavior.
The results of the two studies highlight the flexibility of the perceptual system.
The results also support the idea that changes in acoustic-phonetic representations drive adaption.
