Cross-language transfer from L1 Spanish to L2 English during speech production can create ambiguity between the voiceless stops /p/, /t/, and /k/ and their voiced counterparts /b/, /d/, and /g/ during speech perception.
This perceptual ambiguity between voiced and voiceless stop pairs is a result of their voice onset time (VOT) distributions.
Specifically, Spanish-accented English talkers tend to produce short lag VOTs for voiceless stops, while L1 English listeners tend to associate short lag VOTs with voiced stops.
This dissertation features two studies that explore different aspects of adaptation to Spanish-accented English voiceless stops.
Overall, stop VOT provides a window into the process of adapting to L2-accented speech in behavior (Study 1) and the brain (Study 2).

Study 1 investigated the structure and content of exposure to L2-accented speech in talker-independent adaptation.
There are two competing explanations for how perceptual learning can transfer from one talker to another.
The exposure-to-variability hypothesis argues that increasing covariation between acoustic-phonetic cues during exposure increases performance on a new talker.
The similarity-based hypothesis argues that increasing cue-category overlap between the exposure and test talkers increases performance on the test talker.
To compare these hypotheses, a series of three experiments was conducted with a novel experimental approach that improved the scope and precision of operationalizing variability and similarity compared to previous studies.
Performance on a novel Spanish-accented English talker was measured after exposure to three different Spanish-accented English talkers.
Increasing the similarity between exposure and test facilitated generalization, but only when variability was constrained.
These results provide the strongest support for the similarity-based hypothesis.

Study 2 investigated the relative contributions of acoustic-phonetic and lexico-semantic levels of processing to talker-specific perceptual adaptation.
While behavioral paradigms consistently exhibit rapid improvements in performance with exposure to L2-accented talkers, the effects of perceptual adaptation on neural signatures are less clear.
To clarify previous findings and bring them in line with the behavioral literature, an EEG experiment was conducted that exposed listeners to a Spanish-accented talkerâ€™s VOT-voiceless stop mappings.
Listeners gained experience with ambiguous onsets in the context of multisyllabic real words like *passage*. 
The status of the adaptation process was probed with monosyllabic real words like *park*.
Changes in processing the ambiguous monosyllabic words were investigated as a function of systematic exposure to the unambiguous multisyllabic words in a primed cross-modal go/no-go lexical decision task.
Differences in VOT encoding were observed on the N1 and in phonetic categorization on the P2, which emerged as differences in priming on the N400 disappeared.
These results suggest that changes in acoustic-phonetic representations drive adaptation.
